## Hi, I'm Ajinkya 👋

**Product Engineer, biased toward shipping.**

I build real-world AI products, systems that move from idea to usable software through rapid iteration, tight feedback loops, and real users.

Most of my work sits early in the product lifecycle: shaping vague ideas, building fast prototypes, stress-testing assumptions, and refining based on what actually works in practice. I care less about perfect abstractions and more about momentum.

Outside of code, I’m an ultra-distance cyclist. Endurance sports shaped how I think about building products: pacing over bursts, clarity under fatigue, and compounding small improvements over time. That mindset shows up directly in how I work.
